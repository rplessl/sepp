**** AFS Support for Sepp ... using loopback mounts (lofs) ****

* for file systems mounted with afs, the 'server' must be called 'localhost'

* in order to be able to edit replicated packets stored on AFS, use the
  /usr/sepp/conf/automount_indirect_afswrite automount map

* packages stored on AFS require their install directory to be created before hand

* automount entries with server localhost are NON-REDUNDANT as the redundancy is
  created in AFS

* Creating Package directories for New Packages and Mirrors must be done outside
  sepp so we have to provision for this in seppadm.

* Removing volumes in AFS will not work either same story as above
