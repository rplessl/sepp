Type a longer description of the package and possibly some
information for new users on how to get started with the
program and how further help can be obtained.

In order to make it simple to parse this text please follow
these guidelines when writing the README file.

* separate paragraphs by one empty line. 
* lists should look like this
* to _emphasize_ a word add a underscore to the begin and 
  the end of the word.

1.) enumerated lists look
2.) like this

# lines starting with a hash are comments and will be ignored.

Mark |commands| with vertical bares. They force
a typewriter font when the README is converted to HTML.
