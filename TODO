1 April 2000 : Start of incompatible changes
============================================

- SEPP library in /usr/sepp/lib/perl/SEPP      *** DONE

  This library should make it possible to modularize SEPP and
  put the code in a common directory.
  
- SeppStart.pm -> SEPP::Start, stubs completely changed   *** DONE

  The way applications get started is more clean:
  
  | use SEPP::Start;
  | Start "vim-5.6nodeps-ds", "isg-net";
  
- SEPP::FitOS: standard multi-platform support   *** DONE

  SEPP::FitOS will be a module useable in start.pl to support
  in a easy and standard way multi platform packages.
  
  | use SEPP::FitOS;
  | $OS = FitOS 'sun4m-sun-solaris2.5.1', 'sun4u-sun-solaris2.6';
  | AppRun "$PackDir/$OS/bin";

  => addition of sbin/shtool
  
- removal of sepprc.system and ~/.sepprc:   *** BEGUN: 1 DAY

  These configuration files were seldom used other than determining
  the "SEPP Domain". The SEPP Domain will be thus configured
  in sepp.conf and the reading of such global package configurations
  will be parhaps (if need arises) be reimplemented with a facultative
  module SEPP::UserConfig.
  
  => New section in sepp.conf: "sepp domain"

- Splitting of SEPP disks into SEPP original disks and  *** 2 DAYS
  SEPP mirror disks
  
  => New section in sepp.conf: "sepp mirror disks"

- seppinstall script for easy installation or upgrade. *** BEGUN: 3 DAYS
  The sepp distribution will extract in sepp-2000xxx.xxx
  (installation won't be anymore done through unpacking in /usr/sepp).

- SEPP error handler for errors in start.pl (better error *** 1 DAY
  messages for packages that use new features with an old SEPP version)

- no regular expressions in META file for binaries/man-pages and short   *** 2 DAYS
  description for each binary.

  => New syntax for 'binaries' and 'manpages' sections:

  *** binaries ***
  >>bin/vimsh   the vim shell
  vim		main executable
  vimtutor	vim tutorial
  xxd		hex-dump utility

  *** manpages ***
  man/man1/vimsh.1
  man/man1/vim.1
  man/man1/vimtutor.1
  man/man1/xxd.1

- removal of "Alarm feature"  *** 0 DAYS

- seppadm more flexible about unknown META sections (future compatiblity) *** 0 DAYS

- platform-triplets (shtool guessos) in META 'operating system'.  *** 2 DAYS

- real multiplatform /usr/sepp tree   **** ???
  /usr/sepp/sun4m-sun-solaris2.6/bin (target platforms)
  viele sachen koennten gemeinsam sein: conf, var, html, stub...

Total estimated work: 10 DAYS + 5 DAYS polishing / bug-fixing
  
~ June 2000 : End of incompatible changes, stable release
=========================================================

Planned TODO items:

- allow dependencies with globs (e.g. perl-5.6*-ds)

- build rsync server for free packages and add support to seppadm
  install/mirror to use it.

- put name of local site into web-page.

- add --ancestor <package> switch to prepare for takeing META, README,
  start.pl from previous version of package or from another package ...

- mark packages which are marked for REMOVAL in the report

- add makewindex functionality for sepp on solaris

- allow customized template files accoring to name section of prepared packet ... (-to)

- allow to install several packs at once with mirror (seppadm install -f packages_file)

- SEPP/INSTALL_README -> readme for package installer

- sanity checking for SEPP.packlist

- specification of template directory in seppadm prepare:
  seppadm prepare --template ~dws/sepp/templates/multi_platform

- seppadm publish, seppadm unpublish

- seppadm cleanup|check|repair

- seppadm infobuild

- setuid programs support in META and start.pl -> SetUidRun

- mandatory and optional sections

- install: do a temporary mount to performs checks, so that when an Error
  occurs, the automounter entry doesn't stay.

- delete html files on seppadm remove
